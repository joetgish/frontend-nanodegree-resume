Do Udacity JS and challenge

Bring Earbuds
Discuss watching JS in Host OS - FF or Guest OS FF; may be switching problems which preempts sound working properly.

When instructors talk you through the code, view the code on your laptop, using your tools.
Read the comments in index.html...
Use the sublime editor - to work on this - it has syntax highlighting...

Maybe a paper printout of index.html?



Light on HTML/CSS
refer to W3C schools for HTMl - may be a first workshop - and make a page
This is lightly introduced in Udacity JS course. references are useful to work through.
This is first case of "Earn your knowledge"
Also, consider working through lightly on CSS in W3C schools and links in Udacity Site

What is jQuery? -> Framework! :) 3rd party library

Build IDE to work seamlessly

Build web server (AWS or not) with students 

Lesson 0  - Quizzes
What is div?
What are strategies?
Have an open quiz?

2 tools
Text editor to code
Browser + developer tools - inspect the means the web sites load and run

Use Chrome dev Tools as essential to success
Install fest should require students to work through details of utilities install.
What are command statement to confirm correct install?

May have to replay lessons several times...

What is basic print command for JS?
Does JS require ;?
What is undefined?


$(".super-header-wrapper").html("<img style='width:100%' src='http://goo.gl/WCrBmS'>");

Which indicates that you are using jquery...

Local copy, not actual web site...
Instructors bounce back and forth between pages - stay nimble!

Resume Builder.js should have:
/*
This is empty on purpose! Your code to build the resume will go here.
 */
 $("#main").append("Joseph");
 
 The syntax in the video is sloppy - could be more precise..
